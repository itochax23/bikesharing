# Bike sharing analysis with Tableau

## Overview of the statistical analysis

Our goal was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal using program data from New York City and display the information with interactive, effective visualizations in Tableau. 

Work performed included:
* Using Pandas to change the field Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
* Creating visualizations for the analysis
* Creating a Story in Tableau, and final report to accompany a live presentation to investors

## Results

* There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis
* There is a description of the results for each visualization

## Summary:

The bike sharing program in NYC seems to have the most appeal to men and male-identified people around age 30 for quick trips, particularly in the evenings - and especially on Thursdays. There is a lot of potential for expanding that market, as there are non-male-identified people who use the service but are not subscribers or do not use it regularly.

* More study could be done to figure out the average distance of top stations to nearby tourist attractions, and see if there is an optimal distance to place more bike stations.
* Another opportunity that needs more study is the effect of weather and seasonal changes on the ridership patterns and trends, as well as the bike maintenance required for those seasons.
