# Bike sharing analysis with Tableau

## Overview of the statistical analysis

Our goal was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal using program data from New York City and display the information with interactive, effective visualizations in Tableau. 

Work performed included:
* Using Pandas to change the field Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
* Creating visualizations for the analysis
* Creating a Story in Tableau, and final report to accompany a live presentation to investors

## Results

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)

## Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)

Upload the following to your bikesharing GitHub pages repository:

* The NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb file.
* An updated README.md that has your written analysis with visualizations. 
* Also, embed the Tableau Public link in your README.md file. You can do this in a few ways, but here are the two most popular ones:
